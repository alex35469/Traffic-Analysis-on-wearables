\chapter{Acknowledgments}
In the first place, I wish to thank Ludovic Barman and Apostolos Pyrgelis for making this master project possible, but also for their precious advice, support and good mood all along my master project. I would also like to thank Jonathan Guisolan, Cedric Dumur and Charles Gallay for reading this thesis and their feedback. Finally, I wish to thank my family for always encouraging me and supporting me all along my studies.
